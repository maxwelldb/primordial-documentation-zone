= Using SR-IOV compute machines with a cluster that runs on OpenStack

You can configure your cluster to use SR-IOV. 

== Prerequisites

* You configured your OpenStack deployment according to the OCP guidelines for SR-IOV.
* You installed an OCP cluster.
* You Installed the Performance Addon Operator.
* You configured the Performance Addon Operator with huge pages support.
* You installed the SR-IOV Operator.
* You configured the SR-IOV Operator.
* You configured your SR-IOV network device.
// Documentation for all of these bullets exists.

Are there OSP docs we can link to for this instead, or is what we're asking entirely specific to OCP?

== Add'l steps

* Optional: Configure OVS hardware offloading for your cluster.

// This module looks like it will see changes for the hardware offload epic.
// Let's verify that https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/networking/hardware_networks/configuring-hardware-offloading.html isn't sufficient.
* Deploy a `testpmd` pod or a `testpmd` pod that uses OVS hardware offloading.
